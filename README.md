# DIY-Perks 4-way Speaker (My Own Customizations)

This repo documents my own attempt to build a speaker pair as proposed in this YT-video: [Building EXCEPTIONAL speakers using MODERN TECHNIQUES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEspOD1NHr0).

> Note that I will not provide the files owned by DIYPerks. These can be bought according to the instructions on the video. Though, my own additions are stored here and free to use.


## General Build Instructions

There are a couple of instructions on the Zip archive provided in the package, but note that some details can only be found by carefully watching the video. I have added an extraction of the subtitles in a [separate file](Subtitles.md). The file has headings to help one locate a specific topic and I put important information in **bold** so you din't miss it.


*Work In Progress*
